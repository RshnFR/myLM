# myLM
Implementation of Language Models.


## 1.Tokenizer
Implementation of a tokenizer using de byte pair encoding method

## 2.Logistic Regression
Implementation of a basic logistic regression model. Used a very simple example.
Reimplemented using scikit-learn
Sentiment Analysis done through Stanford's sst2 and imdb database (see utils.py)


## 3.TF-IDF
Implementation of term frequency - inverse document frequency.

## 4.Feedforward Neural Network
Implementation of feedforward neural-network with keras.
Accuracy is pretty low as expected.

## 5.Recurrent Neural Network
Implementation of recurrent neural network.
Accuracy : 0.84

### TO-DO:
Redo everything with existing library.
Redo from scratch (ff-nn,rnn,)
Redo with more complex use cases(utf8 bpe tokenizer)
